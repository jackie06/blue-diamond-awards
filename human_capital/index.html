            <p>
              Logical Advantage was founded in Charlotte in 2003 as a technology consulting firm. In our eleven years we have always worked to be a leader in the technical community of Charlotte and promote learning opportunities for members of the community, as well as grow the opportunities for the development community in this region. Over the course of eleven years we have founded and supported many user groups, organized and funded many events such as the Charlotte Code Camp, and called to action over 60 of our peers to work to create a better ecosystem in this region to teach, attract and retain technical talent - leading to the foundation of IT-oLogy.
            </p>
            <p>
              We work with our clients as well to assist them in the marketing of their own organizations within the technical community, so that they may attract and retain talent as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              In eleven years we have been approached regularly to outsource to other parts of the country as well as off shore our work. We have always worked to keep our talent local and have never wavered from this even when faced with the risk of losing business over rates and availability of staff. -All of the employees at Logical Advantage are passionate about the technology community of Charlotte and regularly volunteer time to speak and organize events such as Cyber Saturday for high school and middle school children. We have hosted high school principals in our office to discuss careers in IT. So far in 2014, LA employees have presented over 52 times to technology audiences both in the CLT region, and throughout the South East.

              Queen Associates was founded in 2000 as a Charlotte-based IT recruiting and consulting firm. In 2011, the firm was transitioned to its current owners and began an aggressive growth strategy resulting in over 900% growth from 2011 to present. To achieve this growth, Queen Associates assembled a team of experienced professionals who combined their recruitment expertise with a strong sense of service and integrity in both client and candidate relationships. Queen Associates grew their client base by 400%, adding clients within the healthcare industry, financial services and insurance. In addition, the firm launched a military recruiting program called Warrior 2 Workforce. This program focuses on transitioning exiting military candidates successfully into private sector careers with Queen Associates' corporate clients. Warrior 2 Workforce also includes assisting military spouses with career development. Robin Pugh, the President of Queen Associates, is a military spouse and had seen first-hand the challenges her husband's military colleagues had faced when returning from deployment in a challenging economic environment.

              Since its first class launched in Spring 2014, Tech Talent South (TTS) has made significant contributions to developing IT talent in the Charlotte area through its intensive code immersion programs. The company strives to be at the forefront of a multifaceted effort to put the South on the map as the next big tech hub and to empower creative thinkers in the region with the skills they need to drive innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
              TTS hosts 8-week beginner-focused programs teaching web development. The company teaches students of all ages and professional backgrounds how to code, giving them the skills needed to build web-based tools, start new companies, pursue careers in development, or simply solve real world problems using technology. The company also enriches the curricular experience by pairing students with established professionals as mentors and by arranging guest lectures and company visits. TTS has also just recently launched a graduate program providing advanced web development training.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hosting classes out of Packard Place, TTS puts its students in the center of the action where they're most likely to have an impact, network with influential players, and find exciting opportunities. TTS will soon have almost 60 graduates in Charlotte, and many have been hired at local start-ups or established businesses (more on this below). As TTS has grown, it has also hired 4 of its own graduates to serve integral marketing, business development, and curriculum development roles within the company. Many TTS graduates are also finding success in pursuing their own web-based businesses. TTS will continue to have an incredible impact in the area by developing talent locally and empowering students with skills they need to contribute to the local tech community to fuel growth in the area. Receiving the Blue Diamond Award will be a significant boost to the company's profile and enable it to fulfill its mission even more.
