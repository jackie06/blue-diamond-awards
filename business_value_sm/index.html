            <p>
              The Barnhardt Integrated Technology Solution consists of three pieces of software: Work Order Generator (WOGEN), Production Scheduler, and Work Order Completion Mobile Application (WOCMA). WOGEN is process that runs on our application server that monitors sales order entry, creates manufacturing work orders, and then assigns then to the proper work centers with the correct due dates based on lead times. Production Scheduler is web application that provides a graphical representation of the manufacturing floor, allows the production supervisor/manager to assign/reassign work orders to different work centers, and provides displays the current status of work orders in production. WOCMA is the production data capture application used by production associates to capture manufacturing and quality assurance data on iPads as well as produce barcode labels. Assignments in Production Scheduler and WOGEN are displayed in WOCMA on the iPads. WOCMA is able to store transactions locally and produce product labels while disconnected from the central servers. The impact of the system was far greater than expected. While we expected the collection of the data and metrics to have a significant impact on decision making, it also streamlined production processes and created excitement in manufacturing. The use of icons and the touch interface allowed for easier training with non-english speaking associates. User adoption of the devices was rapid with many more comfortable with using an iPad rather than a PC.

              The massive growth of ecommerce, estimated to approach $2 trillion in 2015, has persuaded retailers to escalate ecommerce efforts. And the low barrier to entry has attracted millions of small business people to try their hand at Living the American Dream by starting an ecommerce business.
            </p>
            <p>
              As merchants continue to add new sales channels, managing operations becomes increasingly complex. Until recently, integrating data and operational processes across multiple channels has only been affordable for the top one percent of retailers. Ecomdash has made it possible for small and mid-sized merchants to compete, scale and grow in today's omnichannel environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ecomdash is a software-as-a-service, cloud-based technology that enables omnichannel retailers to run their entire business from anywhere in a fraction of the time they spend today with better accuracy and from one central dashboard. At its core, ecomdash is a comprehensive inventory, sales order, purchasing, shipping, and product listing automation and management tool. It seamlessly integrates with marketplaces (e.g. Amazon), ecommerce website platforms (e.g. Magento, Bigcommerce), shipping companies (e.g. Stamps.com), warehouses, fulfillment centers, and suppliers. Unlike competitor Channel Advisor who serves large retailers as a marketing-driven hub to connect-the-dots with 3rd party niche providers for inventory, order management or shipping, ecomdash has built the entire software as an all-in-one.
            </p>
            <p>
              By streamlining the omnichannel supply chain and synchronizing data, 24% of ecomdash customers added new sales channels into their business repertoire. And user data over a 12 month period shows that customers also increased sales revenue by an average of 23% each quarter after implementing ecomdash. As ecommerce and omnichannel retailing continue to evolve quickly, ecomdash plans to be the "best answer" for small and mid-sized merchant needs as new gaps in the marketplace are incrementally revealed.
