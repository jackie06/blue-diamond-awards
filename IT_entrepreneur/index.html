              The Peak 10 concept began when the dot.com era was at its pinnacle.
            </p>
            <p>
              New "Internet data centers" were coming online to serve Corporate America and larger dot.com businesses. David Jones saw a need for this service, but decided to strategically target small and medium businesses (SMB) in emerging growth markets such as Charlotte and Raleigh. David established Peak 10's headquarters and operations in Charlotte in 2001, and for more than a decade the company has served as a business engine for the region. Today, Peak 10 is a national IT infrastructure and cloud services provider, delivering colocation, cloud computing, and a portfolio of managed professional IT services primarily to midsize businesses, with the security, reliability and performance they require. Peak 10 has invested tens of millions of dollars into the Charlotte business economy through its continuous data center expansions over the years. Under his leadership, thousands of midmarket businesses in the region continue to rely on Peak 10 to manage and protect the lifeblood of their business - data. With Peak 10 as their business engine, these customers have gone on to become successful and create new jobs in Charlotte. Under Jones' leadership as chief executive officer, the company's combination of organic growth and acquisitions yielded sizable returns for investors. The company was purchased by private-equity group Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe in September, 2010 in a deal valued at $440 million, the highest valuation of all data-center companies nationwide at the time. And just this year, Peak 10 was purchased by GI Partners for more than $700 million. David's patient strategy for the company and growth has shown success. He has been able to outlast many of his more aggressive competitors. Today Peak 10 operates 300,000 square feet of raised floor space now has roughly 2,000 existing customers both in the US and abroad.

              Brian Kelly saw a market problem and built a solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most companies have hundreds of software applications that they use every day to function - everything from email, databases and collaboration software to ERP and CRM systems to name a few. And many companies have a mixture of software that is old and out of date as well as newer software built for the Facebook age we live in. Where you run your technology is a critical business decision in an age where digital assets are proliferating and security, end user experience and total cost of ownership are real risks to a business. Companies are struggling to keep pace with how fast the market is moving and cloud computing is center stage in their IT evolution. Cloud computing is still a relatively new IT operating model. Most companies understand that cloud has many benefits - efficiency, agility, cost savings to name but a few. But up until now, few companies have demonstrated a best practice for decision making when it comes to moving to the cloud or modernizing their applications to take advantage of cloud. Brian witnessed companies small and large struggling to drive adoption of their cloud technology investments. It is not uncommon to see as little as 10-15% adoption of their investments. Today, most people are attacking the problem through the use of manual methods and spreadsheets. It is an arduous data collection and data analysis. By the time that exercise is done, the market has likely moved on! The scale of the problem Brian set out to solve is enormous and unlike most software companies that build their foundations in Silicon Valley or Boston, Brian had a vision to create something special in his home town, Charlotte, NC. Brian saw the potential in the Charlotte community to help incubate the next $1B technology company. In under 22 months, Brian has taken his idea from a concept to a multi-million dollar computer software company with 23 employees (10 of which were new technology jobs in Charlotte).

              Web-based Software â€“ Mission: to forward education by providing innovative technology solutions to educators
            </div>
            <p>
              Eric Waynick is co-owner, founder and CEO of Thinkgate, which provides web-based software to over 500 education agencies. As the company's CEO, Eric plays an integral role in ensuring that Thinkgate's mission -- to forward education by providing innovative technology solutions to educators -- is being achieved. He is a visionary leader who is responsible for making sure Thinkgate's objectives are met while maintaining the values of our company.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the guidance of Eric Waynick, Thinkgate has experienced significant growth in a short time period. Within the past two years, the company has gained several large, new clients including the Ohio Department of Education, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and Miami Dade County Public Schools, the nation's fourth largest public school district. The company has seen a 178% increase in its total workforce and experienced a 71% increase in revenue since 2011. In 2014, Thinkgate relocated its corporate headquarters to uptown Charlotte to better accommodate its growing workforce, consolidate operations and immerse itself in the burgeoning technology community in uptown.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thinkgate's success is a direct result of Eric's vision and strong leadership skills. Beyond the numbers, though, Eric is truly passionate about improving education. Each day, he reminds Thinkgate's employees of the impact their work has in advancing education. He brings his passion for education to the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce, serving as an Advisory Board Member and member of the Education Committee, a part of the Public Policy Working Group.
