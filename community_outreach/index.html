              FIRST Robotics program at the Olympic Community of Schools
            </div>
            <p>
              Bosch Rexroth USA donated approximately $40,000 and volunteered 3,000 employee mentoring/coaching hours to launch a FIRST Robotics program at the Olympic Community of Schools.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through Bosch Rexroth's FIRST Robotics effort at Olympic, we have been able to have high school students begin mastering advanced CAD programs like Solid Works, as well as use all the Microsoft suite tools in applications that mirror workplace uses marketing, communications, excel, Power Point, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
              In general, Olympic's FIRST Robotics program offers students work-based and experiential learning involving: mechanical and electrical engineering, hands-on fabrication, machining, coding, design, critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, communications & marketing, creativity & innovation, work ethic -- each students commits to 400 work hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              FIRST Robotics is one of the most effective and authentic learning vehicles that we can offer our students because they can apply concepts taught in class in a real world context while professionals mentor them. Students are organized in work teams who address tasks essential to the team's success: Robot design, Robot fabrication, Game strategy, Engineering, Research & Scouting, Fundraising, Marketing & Communications, Website Development, STEM Community Outreach.
            </p>
            <p>
              The target audience who benefits from this outreach program are STEM high school students who are in need of ways to to pursue their curiosity of STEM disciplines that are authentic, real world, and rigorous in nature. The breadth/extent/and logevity of benefits are not measureable. However, after just one year in existence: the team has doubled in size from 30-60 students, students conduct outreach sparking the interest in STEM of middle school and elementary school children who see a path, students have received apprenticeship and internship offers from a variety of multinational firms in need of talent.

            <p>
              The STARS Computing Corps (Corps) is a national resource for the recruitment, retention, and graduation of diverse students in computing through student-led regional engagement. STARS stands for Students & Technology in Academics, Research, and Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              STARS activities are geared to advance the STARS Central Values of (*)Excellence - Technical skill , including confidence and interest in computing, workforce preparation; innovation & advancement; (*) Leadership - Soft skills, including management, teamwork, writing, communication, and work / life balance; (*)Community - A sense of belonging and a common computing identity not tied to gender, race, ethnicity or physical abilities; (*)Service & Civic Engagement - Sense of responsibility to use computing to serve society. The Charlotte Region STARS community includes STARS Computing Corps at UNC Charlotte, Johnson C. Smith University, Central Piedmont Community College, and Winthrop University. These STARS Corps have catalyzed regional partnerships through the tiered participation of students, professionals and educators in civic engagement and experiential learning. The outcomes have targeted two areas: 1) higher retention in computing by local college students through significant positive impact on computing efficacy (belief that effort will lead to success in a computing curriculum), perceived social relevance of computing (belief that computing has social as well as technical relevance and can be used to benefit individuals and society), computing commitment (intention to remain in the field of computing through college and into the workplace), computing identity (a feeling of inclusion in a larger computing community), and self-reported grade point average; and 2) increased exposure of K-12 students to the opportunities in computing majors and jobs through hands-on outreach activities.

              WINGS Program
            </div>
            <p>
              Women Executives (WE) is a diverse group of accomplished professional women in Charlotte, North Carolina, whose mission is to support and nurture each other's personal and career growth. WE members provide monetary scholarships and executive mentoring through their Women Initiating and Nurturing Growth through Scholarships (WINGS) program.
            </p>
            <p>
              WINGS, the sole philanthropic initiative of WE, provides support for non-traditional female undergraduate students, 25 years or older, who are pursuing higher education. This program is managed under Women Executives for Community Service (WECS), the 501c3 non-profit arm of WE. WINGS Scholars have a clear financial need, juggle work and family commitments along with their studies, and many are the first to graduate in their families.
            </p>
            <p>
              The national percentages for the graduation rates of non-traditional students is only in the single digits, mainly due to all of the obstacles and life challenges that interfere with their studies. To date, the WINGS program has experienced a 77% rate, in stark contrast to national averages.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2014, WECS had a vision of launching a technology initiative to greatly enrich our WINGS program, as well as support and empower our WINGS Scholars. In today's technological world, it is nearly impossible to be successful and graduate with honors from college without technology knowledge, equipment, and support. One of our WINGS community champion organizations, the CommunityOne Bank Foundation, stepped up to the plate to sponsor and fund our Technology 1st initiative for the next three years. WECS is extremely proud of this partnership, and the positive impact that the technology program has already made on our WINGS Scholars!
