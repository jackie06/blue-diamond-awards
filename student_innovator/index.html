              Diabetics often have to make important decisions regarding caloric intake. Michael Kersting created Piabetes as a software solution designed to be used by diabetics to access data they might find useful, such as carbohydrates and dietary fiber information when internet access is limited or slow. Piabetes works by using a man in the middle, a Raspberry Pi, that has an internet connection. The user sends a SMS requesting food information over the phone to the Pi at their house, which has a good internet connection. The Pi then queries Wolfram Alpha for information and sends that data back to the user via SMS, effectively eliminating the need for 3G or other form of internet connection on the users end. Even with weak cell service, messages can be sent and received faster than if standard 3G had been used.

              Zack's engineering brilliance continually amazes all that he encounters. This brilliance has been disseminated to many students as it relates to Robotics and overall engineering. Zack keeps an engineering notebook in his possession at all times documenting, sketching, and calculating various self-initiated engineering projects. He is constantly brainstorming ways to create and redesign concepts and uses every chance to tinker in the workshop and any available break during and after school. A few of Zack's engineering projects are:
            </p>
            <p>
              Designing the FRC (First Robotics Competition) competition robots for POB. Responsible for the mechanical, electrical, and programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              Transforming an FRC competition robot to a t-shirt cannon for POB to use at sporting events and as a means to market the robotics team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Creating a lock for his bedroom door with an automatic self-locking mechanism.
            </p>
            <p>
              Creating a prototype of a mini plastic injection molding machine. Currently changing a storage unit behind his home to a workshop/living space for himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              His next engineering project is building a motorcycle. All designs are currently in his engineering notebook Zack has the ability to design, present, and produce highly usable and innovative products. He continuously pushes himself to be creative and progressive. He is always thinking is always of what could he do next.
