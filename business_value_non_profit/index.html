              Simplicity

            <p>
              Apparo created a program 4 years ago to break the cycle of technology break/fix for area small nonprofits (less than 10 employees). Through that program funds were raised to provide participating nonprofits with new laptops for employees, a networkable printer, a NAS device and cloud-based infrastructure. This was the beginning of a Shared Services model, named Simplicity, designed to help nonprofits transform their mission delivery via mobile technology and processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The initial 3 years of the program were a learning curve for all involved, including the technology being significantly changed by Microsoft to settle this past year in the Microsoft Office 365 platform. This past year, Simplicity has truly hit its stride, serving 13 agencies - 3 of whom are new in the past year. There is a subsidy for Managed Services; there is a collaborative meeting twice a year; there is orientation for the Microsoft Office 365 as well as implementation of the platform for new members; and there is 4 hours of onsite training and support from Apparo team members over the course of the year.
            </p>
            <p>
              We estimate that the three years of the program cost more than $400,000 and delivered more than 500 hours of technology guidance and training, $102,000 in hardware, and true transformation for the way these 13 agencies deliver their missions in our community. This past year alone, has delivered an additional 100 hours of consulting support and $25,500 in direct Managed Care subsidies to these 13 agencies. As one has said, "we would not have been able to meet the rising demand for our services during the economic downturn without the flexibility, training and strategic support or Apparo's Simplicity program."
            </p>
            <p>
              Apparo is hoping that the winning of this award will highlight the impact potential of this program to bring new players, both nonprofit beneficiaries and corporate sponsors, to the table of a shared services model for technology support of smaller nonprofits in the region.

              As the City of Charlotte grows and experiences land use changes, leaders recognized the need for accurate address information to deliver services. Until the implementation of a MDM solution for its address domain, the City lacked a centralized repository for managing physical and mailing address information. While Mecklenburg County functions as the physical address authority for both the City and County, the timing of address data availability and level of address granularity created challenges for departments to provide services. This deficiency led to duplicate or erroneous address records that created additional challenges with service delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inaccurate address information was able to creep into databases whenever a name was misspelled or a duplicate address was entered, to cite two common examples. To mitigate this problem, the City embarked on an Address Management Program that included a business process engineering study and the technical implementation of a master data management (MDM) solution. The MDM approach was identified to focus on automated data quality capabilities to cleanse address/location data & to provide a central repository. We needed a master set of address records that could be used for location & mailing purposes. We also wanted to obtain a complete understanding of all address processes, from the time that an address is created throughout the history of its use.
            </p>
            <p>
              The City purchased iWay Software to automate data profiling, cleansing, matching, merging, enrichment, remediation, & monitoring activities. It enables the City to carefully check its data records, identify duplicates, standardize discrepancies, remediate exceptions &create a master database of "golden address records" with associated x & y coordinates (for geo-coding), USPS address labels, tax data & tax fee data. The result is a consistent set of master records that can feed multiple information systems, improve accuracy & give users a more complete view of address data.

              Digital Learning Transformation
            </div>
            <p>
              Advancing 21st Century Learning, Digital Learning Transformation Goal One of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools' Strategic Plan 2018 is to, "Maximize academic achievement in a personalized 21st-century learning environment for every child to graduate college-and career-ready." The vision is to transform 165 schools serving over 140,000 students into places of digital learning and teaching, where students have a personalized education experience based on their interests, career goals and skills. We know that using a blended model of teaching with technology tools, teachers can vastly increase the level of student engagement. However, in 2012, CMS had no schools with infrastructure to support personalized learning. Under Dr. Truesdale's leadership, a systematic plan for Digital Learning Conversion has begun.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is to jump start the transformation of 165 schools by a) providing technology-enabled classrooms to access high quality learning experiences, b) developing a personalized plan of learning for each child, c) supporting children so they move through school with peers, d) imbedding professional learning for staff so they can lead this learning transformation and e) varying learning time by extending the school day and augmenting summer learning, actually or virtually. Tracking key measures to guarantee targeted outcomes is also an essential foundation.
