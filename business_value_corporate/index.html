              Sales Fulfillment Transformation
            </div>
            <p>
              Bank of America automated their online account opening process (processing requests for products submitted through online applications for various types of customers and deposit accounts). The project was named the Sales Fulfillment Transformation (SFT) project. The Bank used RedHat JBPM 5 to dramatically improve customer satisfaction (product fulfillment reduced from 16 hours to 26 seconds) and efficiency (standard platform that is easily maintained and supported). The new platform resulted in eliminating human error in account creation while CSR workload and desktop procedures were greatly reduced and simplified. Finally, the new platform mitigated potential regulatory compliance issues that occur with manual intervention.

              LPL's new cloud-based trading platform allows advisors to save valuable time when making portfolio changes. Advisors can perform a range of trading and rebalancing activities for any number of securities, client portfolios and accounts. The Enhanced Trading platform features block trading capabilities that calculate average prices, allocations and trailing stop orders to help protect market gains while managing downside risk. This technology offers advisors significant time savings, allowing them to react to market conditions faster and focus on what really matters-their clients. LPL Financial Managing Director and Chief Information Officer Victor Fetter noted, Introducing the Enhanced Trading and Rebalancing platform has been one of LPL Financials top priorities, and is representative of the strides we have made in advancing the company's overall technology strategy. We are directly addressing what our advisors have told us they need and want.

              CareLink Mobile Nurse Station
            </div>
            <p>
              As the leader in “point-of-care” workstations with over 100,000 units deployed over 10 years, Rubbermaid Healthcare had to design its 4th generation mobile nurse station cart. Carts are used in hospitals as nurses’ workstations when documenting electronic medical records, transporting supplies and medications, and for telemedicine solutions. They must accommodate a wide range of computers, displays, and peripheral devices such as scanners, printers, and vital signs monitoring. These workstations are used by nursing and other clinicians in patient care throughout most acute care units, including general medical/surgical, critical care, surgery, and ER. These carts are one of the most heavily used (24/7) and have “more miles” on them than any other clinical equipment in a hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior generations of workstations, and competitors’ carts, utilized “dumb” electronics-based technology with limited features, plastic membrane buttons/keypads and possibly a small LED display. An analogy would be the difference between today’s upgradeable smart phones versus old cell phones that only had the features that came pre-installed. The carts were inflexible lacking ability to add features, make changes, and were reliant on client software installed on the hospital’s computer in the cart to supply any “smart” capabilities, such as battery monitoring or PIN codes. Where offered, remote management required installing server software. Electronics-based and client-server software architectures became unwieldy to install and maintain, and were too inflexible.
            </p>
            <p>
              To respond to these challenges, Rubbermaid Healthcare developed the CareLink Mobile Nurse Station, the first smart connected nursing cart in the market. CareLink connects with N-Sight, a cloud-based system to remotely monitor and manage the fleet of carts. Rubbermaid Healthcare applied for a patent for the overall design, which is an early, large scale, successful example of an “Internet of Things” solution in healthcare.
